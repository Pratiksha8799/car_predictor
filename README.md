# Car Selling Price Predictor ðŸ¤–

The Car Selling Price Predictor is a machine learning model designed to estimate the selling price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. To help sellers and buyers make informed decisions, accurate price predictions are provided.



## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x

- Scikit-learn (sklearn): Provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. 
    
    Modules:

        preprocessing: LabelEncoder, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder

        model_selection: train_test_split

        metrics: mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

        linear_model: LinearRegression

- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

        matplotlib.pyplot: matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to Matplotlib.

- Seaborn: Ideal for statistical plots and quick, attractive visualizations with less code.




## Setup and Installation

- Install Necessary Software

Install Python and Jupyter Notebook:

    pip install notebook

- Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

- Launch Jupyter Notebook

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    jupyter notebook

Navigate to Your Notebook: This will open a new tab in your web browser. Navigate to the directory where car-price-predictor.ipynb is located and click on the file to open it.

4. Run the Notebook

Run All Cells: Once the notebook is open, you can run all the cells sequentially. You can do this by clicking Kernel in the menu, then Restart & Run All. This will restart the kernel and run all cells from the top.












## Used By

- Car Dealerships

    Purpose: To estimate the selling price of used cars.

    Benefit: Helps in pricing cars accurately based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, etc., ensuring competitive pricing and improving sales.

- Car Buyers

    Purpose: To understand the fair market value of a car they intend to purchase.

    Benefit: Provides insights into whether the asking price is reasonable based on the car's attributes and market trends.

- Insurance Companies

    Purpose: To set insurance premiums based on the car's market value.

    Benefit: Ensures that the premiums are aligned with the car's current market worth, which can reduce risk and increase profitability.

- Academic and Educational Purposes
    
    Purpose: To teach students about data science and machine learning concepts.
    
    Benefit: Acts as a practical project for students to work on, helping them understand the end-to-end process of building a predictive model.

## Future scope:
- Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application where users can input car details and get price predictions. Technologies like Flask or Django can be used for backend development.
- Mobile Application: Create a mobile app for car price predictions, making the tool accessible on the go.
- Dealer Management Systems (DMS): Integrate with DMS for car dealerships to help them price their inventory more accurately.




##  Conclusion ðŸš€

The car price predictor project demonstrates a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem: estimating the selling price of used cars.
